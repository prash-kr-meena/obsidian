Cloud computing Categorized based on the deployment models

## 1. Public Cloud

- Public cloud is a type of cloud computing in which a cloud service provider makes computing resources available to users over the public internet
	- resorces can be anything from SaaS applications, to individual [[What are virtual machines (VMs)|virtual machines (VMs)]] , to [[What is a Bare Metal Server?|bare metal computing hardware]], to complete enterprise-grade infrastructures and development platforms
	- offered by [[Cloud Computing#Cloud Service Providers|CSPs]] like AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, etc.
- Customers access resources through subscription-based or pay-per-usage models.
- The provider owns and manages the data centers, hardware, and infrastructure.
- It is a [[What is multi-tenant (or multitenancy)?|multi-tenant environment]], serving millions of customers.
	- ie the cloud provider's data center infrastructure is shared by all public cloud customers.
- Enterprises adopt public cloud for [[Elasticity in Cloud Computing|elasticity]], scalability, and workload flexibility.
- It offers efficiency, cost savings, and reduces reliance on on-premises infrastructure.

## 2. Private Cloud

- Private cloud is a cloud environment in which all cloud infrastructure and computing resources are dedicated to, and accessible by, one customer only. 
  
- Private cloud combines many of the benefits of cloud computing—including elasticity, scalability, and ease of service delivery—with the access control, security, and resource customization of on-premises infrastructure.
  
- A private cloud is typically hosted on-premises in the customer's data center. But a private cloud can also be hosted on an independent cloud provider’s infrastructure or built on rented infrastructure housed in an offsite data center.
  
- Many companies choose private cloud over public cloud because private cloud is an easier way (or the only way) to meet their regulatory compliance requirements. 
	- Others choose private cloud because their workloads deal with confidential documents, intellectual property, personally identifiable information (PII), medical records, financial data, or other sensitive data.

  
- By building private cloud architecture according to [[Cloud native]] principles, organizations get the flexibility to move workloads to public or hybrid cloud environments when needed.

## 3. Hybrid Cloud

- Hybrid cloud combines public and private cloud environments into a single flexible infrastructure, for running the organization's applications and workloads.
  
- Hybrid cloud aims to establish a mix of public and private cloud resources with a level of orchestration between them, such that it gives the organization flexibility to choose the optimal cloud for each application or workload and move them freely between the clouds depending on the requirements and circumstances
	- Basically The goal is to have flexibility in choosing the right cloud for each application or workload.

- This wayt Hybrid cloud enables organizations to meet technical and business objectives effectively and cost-efficiently.

## 4. Multi Cloud and hybrid multicloud

- **Multicloud** refers to using two or more clouds from different cloud providers (with services including SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS services).
- It allows organizations to avoid vendor lock-in, access more services, and benefit from increased innovation.

- **Hybrid multicloud** combines two or more public clouds with a private cloud environment.
- Managing a multicloud environment can be challenging due to different management tools, data transmission rates, and security protocols.

- Multicloud management platforms provide a centralized dashboard for visibility and monitoring across multiple provider clouds.
	- where development teams can see their projects and deployments,  
	- operations team can keep an eye on clusters and nodes and 
	- The cybersecurity staff can monitor for threats
