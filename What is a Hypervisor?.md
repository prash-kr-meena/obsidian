Hypervisor is a small software layer that enables multiple instances of [[operating systems]] to run alongside each other, sharing the same physical computing resources. 
This process is called [[Virtualization]], and the operating system instances are referred to as [[What are virtual machines (VMs)|virtual machines (VMs) ]]— software emulations of physical computers.


Hypervisor is also known as **virtual machine monitor** (VMM) manages these VMs as they run alongside each other. The hypervisor allocates physical computing resources—such as processors, memory, and storage—to each VM. It keeps each VM separate from others, so they don’t interfere with each other. so if, for example, one OS suffers a crash or a security compromise, the others survive
