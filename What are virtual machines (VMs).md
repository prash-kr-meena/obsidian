A virtual machine is a virtual representation, or emulation, of a physical computer. They are often referred to as a **guest**,while the physical machine they run on is referred to as the **host**.

Each VM runs its own operating system (OS) and behaves like an independent computer, even though it is running on just a portion of the actual underlying computer hardware.


A VM cannot interact directly with a physical computer. Instead, it needs a lightweight software layer called a [[What is a Hypervisor?|hypervisor]] to coordinate between it and the underlying physical hardware.


This technology can go by many names, including 
- **virtual server**, 
- **virtual server instance (VSI)** and 
- **virtual private server (VPS)**,
