A virtual machine is a virtual representation, or emulation, of a physical computer. They are often referred to as a **guest**,while the physical machine they run on is referred to as the **host**.

Each VM runs its own operating system (OS) and behaves like an independent computer, even though it is running on just a portion of the actual underlying computer hardware.
