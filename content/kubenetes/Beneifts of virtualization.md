1. **Slash your IT expenses**
	Virtualization can reduce IT expenses by consolidating applications onto fewer physical servers.
	
>Utilizing a non-virtualized environment can be inefficient because when you are not consuming the application on the server, the compute is sitting idle and can't be used for other applications. When you virtualize an environment, that single physical server transforms into many virtual machines. These virtual machines can have different operating systems and run different applications while still all being hosted on the single physical server.


2. **Reduce downtime and enhance resiliency in disaster recovery situations**
	Virtualization can enhance resiliency in disaster recovery situations by allowing for quick and easy replication or cloning of virtual machines from one physical server to another.

>When a disaster affects a physical server, someone is responsible for replacing or fixing it—this could take hours or even days. With a virtualized environment, <u>it’s easy to provision and deploy</u>, allowing you to replicate or clone the virtual machine that’s been affected. The recovery process would take mere minutes—as opposed to the hours it would take to provision and set up a new physical server—significantly enhancing the resiliency of the environment and improving business continuity.


3. **Increase efficiency and productivity**
	Virtualization can improve scalability and flexibility by allowing for easy deployment and management of virtual machines, Instead of doing this laborious and tedious process of applying the updates server-by-server. 

>With fewer servers, your IT teams will be able to spend less time maintaining the physical hardware and IT infrastructure. You’ll be able to install, update, and maintain the environment across all the VMs in the virtual environment on the server instead of going through the laborious and tedious process of applying the updates server-by-server. 
>Less time dedicated to maintaining the environment increases your team’s efficiency and productivity.

4. **Control independence and DevOps**
	Virtualization enables developers to create virtual machines for testing and development, without affecting the production environment, resulting in faster and more agile application development and deployment.

>Since the virtualized environment is segmented into virtual machines, your developers can quickly spin up a virtual machine without impacting a production environment. This is ideal for Dev/Test, as the developer can quickly clone the virtual machine and run a test on the environment.
>
>For example, if a new software patch has been released, someone can clone the virtual machine and apply the latest software update, test the environment, and then pull it into their production application. This increases the speed and agility of an application.

 
5. **Move to be more green-friendly (organizational and environmental)**
	 When you are able to cut down on the number of physical servers you’re using, it’ll lead to a reduction in the amount of power being consumed. 
	 
	 This has two green benefits:
	-   It reduces expenses for the business, and that money can be reinvested elsewhere.
	-   It reduces the carbon footprint of the data center
