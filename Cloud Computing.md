Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet ("the cloud") rather than relying on local servers or personal computers for data storage and processing. 

In cloud computing, users can access computing resources, such as storage, processing power, and software applications, on-demand and pay only for the resources they consume. This eliminates the need for organizations or individuals to invest in and maintain their own physical infrastructure, which can be expensive and time-consuming.
