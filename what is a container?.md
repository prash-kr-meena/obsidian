In the context of computing,
- A container is a lightweight, isolated, and **executable runtime instance** that runs an application and all its dependencies in an isolated environment. 
- Containers are created from container images and are typically used to run and deploy applications in a consistent and portable manner.
- Containers provide an isolated and consistent environment for applications to run, regardless of the host system they are running on.


**Container images become containers at runtime**


Hence we can say in short
- A container is a <u>standard unit of software</u> that packages up the application code and all its dependencies, so the application can run quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
