Cloud computing Categorized based on the different services models

Cloud computing offers a range of services that cater to different needs and <u>levels of abstraction</u>. 


Three primary types of cloud computing services:

## 1. [[Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)]]
   - IaaS provides users with virtualized computing resources over the internet. 
   - It offers fundamental infrastructure components, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking capabilities. 
   - Users have control over the operating systems, applications, and configurations deployed on the provided infrastructure. 
   - Examples of IaaS providers include 
	   - Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2
	   - Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines, and 
	   - Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Compute Engine

## 2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
   - PaaS provides a platform and environment for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. 
   - It includes the infrastructure components provided by IaaS, along with development tools, middleware, and database management systems. 
   - PaaS abstracts away the complexities of infrastructure management, allowing developers to focus on application development. 
   - Examples of PaaS offerings include 
	   - AWS Elastic Beanstalk
	   - Azure App Service, and 
	   - Google App Engine
	   - Heroku

## 3. Software as a Service (SaaS)
   - SaaS delivers complete software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. 
   - Users can access and use these applications directly through a web browser, eliminating the need for local installation and management.
   - The software is centrally hosted and maintained by the provider.
   - Examples of SaaS applications include 
	   - customer relationship management (CRM) tools like Salesforce
	   - productivity suites like Google Workspace and Microsoft 365
	   - and collaboration platforms like Slack and Zoom

### Additional Specialized cloud services

Additionally, there are other specialized cloud services and deployment models:

1. **Database as a Service (DBaaS)**
   - DBaaS provides managed database services, allowing users to store, manage, and access databases without worrying about infrastructure management. 
   - Examples: AWS RDS, Azure SQL Database, and GCP Cloud SQL
   
2. **Functions as a Service (FaaS)/Serverless Computing**
   - FaaS enables developers to execute functions or code snippets in response to events or triggers without managing the underlying infrastructure. 
   - The cloud provider automatically scales and provisions resources as needed. 
   - AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions are popular serverless platforms.
   
3. **Containers as a Service (CaaS)**
   - CaaS provides a platform for deploying and managing containerized applications. 
   - It abstracts away the infrastructure complexities of container orchestration and management. 
   - Examples include 
	   - AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
	   - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and 
	   - GCP Kubernetes Engine

4. **Hybrid Cloud**
   - Hybrid cloud combines public cloud services with on-premises infrastructure or private clouds. 
   - It allows organizations to take advantage of the scalability and flexibility of public cloud while maintaining control over sensitive data and applications.


These services provide a range of options for organizations and individuals to leverage cloud computing based on their specific requirements, from low-level infrastructure access to complete software applications.
