[[Containerization]] is a type of operating **system-level virtualization** that allows **multiple isolated user-space (called *container*) instances** to run on a single operating system kernel. 
This operating system kernel can by in any cloud, non-cloud environment, regardless of the type of vendor. (Hence no vendon lock int)


Containers share the same host operating system, but each container has its own
- file system, 
- network stack, and 
- process space. 
In contrast, traditional virtualization involves running multiple virtual machines on a single host, each with <u>its own operating system and kernel</u>.

## Advantages of Containerization
Containerization provides several advantages over traditional virtualization, such as 
- lower overhead, 
- faster startup times, 
- and higher density. 

Containerization also enables the <u>efficient deployment</u> and **scaling of applications**, making it a popular choice for modern application development and deployment.
