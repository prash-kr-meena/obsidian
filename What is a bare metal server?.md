- Bare metal servers are a form of [[Cloud Computing Services#1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)|cloud services]] in which the user rents a physical machine from a provider that is **not shared with any other tenants**.

- Unlike traditional [[Cloud Computing]], which is based on [[What are virtual machines (VMs)|virtual machines]], bare metal servers do not come with a [[What is a Hypervisor?|hypervisor]] pre-installed and **give the user complete control over their server infrastructure**.

- With a bare metal server, because users get complete control over the physical machine, they have the **flexibility** <u>to choose their own operating system</u>, **avoid the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">“noisy neighbor”</mark> challenges** <u>of shared infrastructure</u>, and finely tune hardware and software for specific, often data-intensive, workloads.

- Along with virtual machines, [networking](https://www.ibm.com/topics/networking), and [storage](https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-storage), bare metal servers are a foundational component of the [[Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)]] stack in cloud computing.


## Benefits of bare metal servers
- Bare metal servers offer high performance with dedicated physical hardware.
- They provide resource isolation, eliminating noisy neighbor issues.
- Users have flexibility and customization options for operating systems and hardware configurations.
- Bare metal servers enhance security and compliance by offering dedicated hardware.
- They are scalable, allowing organizations to adjust resources based on workload demands.
- Users have complete control and management over the infrastructure.
- Bare metal servers can optimize licensing and reduce virtualization costs.
- They may require advanced IT skills for management and maintenance.
