A container is a lightweight, isolated, and executable runtime instance that runs an application and all its dependencies in an isolated environment. Containers are created from container images and are typically used to run and deploy applications in a consistent and portable manner.

In the context of computing,
- a container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that contains everything needed to run a piece of software, including application code, runtime environment, system tools, libraries, and settings. 
- Containers provide an isolated and consistent environment for applications to run, regardless of the host system they are running on.

	
Hence we can say in short
- A container is a <u>standard unit of software</u> that packages up the application code and all its dependencies, so the application can run quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.


**Container images become containers at runtime**
