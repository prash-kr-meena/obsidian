A container and a container image are related concepts in the world of [[containerization]], but they are not the same thing.

Containers are based on the concept of operating system-level virtualization, where multiple isolated user-space instances can run on a single operating system kernel. Containers share the same kernel as the host operating system, but each container has its own file sysstem, network stack, and process space.

Containers can be managed using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes, which automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containers across multiple hosts. Containers are popular in modern software development and deployment because they offer a fast, reliable, and scalable way to package and distribute software applications.


A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
